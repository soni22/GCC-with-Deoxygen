1. Write a C program that accepts 'n' user-names one-by-one and prints them in a sorted order. A linked list has to be used to maintain the set of names to keep the value of 'n' variable. Each node in the list stores a user-name. When a name is entered it is inserted at its 'proper place' in the list. After all names are entered, the list is printed.

2. The linked list operations (addition, insertion, deletion) should be implemented in a separate file (userlist.c). A makefile should be used to build the the executable 'user-sorter'.

3. The program should be commented using doxygen style comments and doxygen should be used to generate reports in html and latex (which has to be compiled into a pdf). Mention your name, description of each function and its parameters at appropriate places in the program with doxygen-style tags so that this information automatically appears in the generated reports.


Example:

Enter user name: yyy

(list: yyy)

Do you wish to continue? y

Enter user name: ppp

(list: ppp->yyy)

Do you wish to continue? y

Enter user name: rrr

(list: ppp->rrr->yyy)

Do you wish to continue? n

sorted list:
ppp
rrr
yyy
